# Cybersecurity Project (ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing & NDK Reverse Shell)

## Overview
This repository contains coursework for the **CSCS495 Cyber Security** class project.  
The project demonstrates, in a controlled lab environment, three main tasks:

1. ARP Spoofing ‚Äì Intercepting traffic between a victim and router on a local network.
2. DNS Spoofing ‚Äì Redirecting victim traffic to a spoofed server using crafted DNS responses.
3. NDK Reverse Shell (Android) ‚Äì Compiling a reverse shell with the Android NDK and executing it in an emulator to demonstrate remote access.
